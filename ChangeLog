v0.5.0 (Oct 5, 2011)
----------------
	* Use fast instructions for certain operations when compiling
	  MessageSends. This speeds up things like Fixnum arithmetic.
	* Require rubygems and ruby dependencies in generated include file
	  when installing a fancy package.
	* Small improvements to actors example
	* Added FutureSend#failure and use correct mutex in
	  FutureSend#failed:
	* Added another dynamic scoping example using *stdout*
	* Removed weird goto shit
	* Performance improvements for loops of up to 10x in certain cases
	  by using dynamic_method() for the lower-level logic of
	  while_true:. Still allow next/break to work, as expected by
	  wrapping lower-level implementation in Block#while_true:. #speeed!
	* Added more methods and tests to Array and Tuple.
	* Added Symbol#arity for compatibility with Block api.
	* Small doctoring fix to Object#do:
	* Simplified Person example
	* Simplified actor ring example.
	* Added @return to doctoring for Object#do:
	* Small fix to boot/code_loader so bin/fdoc works again.
	* Removed obsolete Array#any?:
	* Return false in FancyEnumerable#any?:
	* Added Symbol#call in boot/fancy_ext/ to allow symbols being used
	  as callables when passing them to ruby code.
	* Use alias for Ruby's Array#[]= in Array#[]: instead of
	  Object#ruby:args:
	* Small changes to Array methods.
	* Added Class#ruby_aliases:
	* Small improvement to Array#inspect
	* Small fix to fancy-mode.el for parsing symbols
	* small typo fix
	* updated README and doc/features (mentioning dynamic scoping)
	* Added boot/fancy_ext/bootstrap.rb which is needed during
	  bootstrap process so *stdout* is defined and "rake -v" works.
	* Use short-cut conditional messages in Block methods.
	* Added missing FalseClass#if_nil:else:
	* Return self in Object#do:
	* Use String#include? in Object#message_name: to get rid of weird
	  crash on rbx-2.0.0pre. Need to look into the actual cause of the
	  crash later.
	* print duration of running tests when running fspecp
	* Small fix to FutureSend: Send future message to receiver's actor
	  after setting up FutureSend object.
	* Don't auto-load FancySpec on startup. Load it explicitly in
	  bin/fspec instead.
	* small fix to copying dynamic vars in Thread#new
	* Added support for preserving the values of dynamic vars when
	  spawning a new thread based on the values in the current thread.
	* Small fixes to tests.
	* Added lib/vars.fy and load it in lib/boot.fy on startup. Also
	  use *stdout* in Object#println.
	* Added support for dynamic variable bindings using
	  let:be:in:. Uses * surrounding variable names to indicate dynamic
	  variable, e.g. *stdin* or *dynamic_var*.
	* Added another Future test
	* ignore .rbx dir
	* Fixed concurrency issues with FutureSend class on rbx-2.0.0pre
	* Added ConditionVariable wrapper class.
	* Added Mutex wrapper class to lib/rbx/.
	* Sort values before comparing in Set test.
	* Array#println returns nil
	* More tests for Set
	* Added missing tests for Stack.
