This directory contains all the code for compiling Fancy source files
(.fy) to Rubinius bytecode files (.fyc).

The compiler implementation is in the compiler/ directory.

The parser/ directory contains the bison & flex written parser and
lexer which are used as a C-extension in rbx to generate the
appropriate AST node instances in parser/parser.rb.
