This directory contains all the code that deals with parsing Fancy
source files (.fy) and creating an object-oriented representation (a
so-called AST - Abstract Syntax Tree) from it to be used in the
compiler for further processing (mostly to .fyc bytecode files).

The parser.y file contains the grammar rules in GNU Bison (YACC
compatible) syntax, which make up the parser. The parser actions are
written in C and call out to Ruby methods defined in parser.rb via
rbx's C-extension interface to build the actual AST objects.

The lexer.y contains the lexer rules in GNU Flex syntax for scanning a
source file for tokens.

The parser.rb file contains all the methods used by the parser to
create AST objects.


==

Currently the parser is being re-implemented using kpeg. 
If you want to work on the parser use vic/kpeg to generate the 
ruby parser.
