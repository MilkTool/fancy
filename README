The Fancy Programming Language

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fancy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language heavily
inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby and Erlang. It will support dynamic code
evaluation (as in Ruby & Smalltalk), concurrency via the actor-model
and many more features yet to be implemented.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Itâ€™s still in development, the implementation consisting of an
interpreter written in C++ and a working bytecode compiler for the
Rubinius VM (http://www.rubini.us).
We're currently working on bootstrapping the language on the Rubinius VM.
If you want to help out, feel free to contact us:

For some example code (that can be successfully executed), have a look
at the examples/ directory.

There's also lots of test coverage code. Have a look at the tests/
directory for these. The tests are written in FancySpec, a simple
testing library (somewhat similar to Ruby's RSpec). FancySpec's
implementation can be viewed in lib/fancy_spec.fnc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling / Installing from source:
------------------------------------

Dependencies:
------------------------

- libgc ( Fancy uses BoehmGC for garbage collection ).
- GNU Autotools: autoconf, automake and libtool.
- GNU Make.
- GNU Bison ( version 2.4 and higher otherwise you will get a Segmentation fault ).
- GNU Flex.

NOTE: BoehmGC - It's included in the vendor/gc directory
           but you can also get it here:
           http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/.

Given the tools & libraries mentioned above, Fancy _should_ build without problems
on most *nix systems. We successfully have built Fancy on Debian & Ubuntu, OpenSuSE
and Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.

Standard building procedure:
------------------------

Building Fancy is just that easy:

  $ cd <fancy_source_path>
  $ ./configure
  $ make && make test

NOTE: if you have problems with ./configure script or make utility just try:

  $ autoreconf --install --force

and try again.

Some technical information:
----------------------------


What's already working?
------------------------

  - Class definitions
    (including nested classes that work like modules / namespaces)
  - Instance & class method definitions
  - String, Integer, Float, Array, Hash (HashMap) & Block literals
  - Method & Operator calls
  - Instance & class variable access
  - Dynamic getter and setter method definitions (similar to Ruby's attr_acessor)
  - Loops
  - Support for closures via Blocks (it works but there's definately
    room for performance improvements)
  - Local & non-local returns from Blocks & Methods
  - File reading and writing
  - Class-Mixins (including methods of one class into another)
  - Exception handling (try, catch, finally & retry)
  - There's also an experimental bytecode compiler for the Rubinius VM
    (see rbx_bytecode branch). It's still in development and not
    finished yet.


What's still missing?
----------------------

  - Pattern matching
  - Concurrency stuff (Actor-model based concurrency, Futures etc)
  - Some more advanced stuff, e.g. runtime inspection of method calls
    via MethodContext etc. (saved for later)


How is it implemented?
-----------------------

  - Currently, theres a quite simple interpreter written in
    non-idiomatic C++.
    Sorry, I'm not a big C++ programmer. It should be fairly easy to
    read though.

  - It uses the BoehmGC for garbage collection.

  - The lexer & parser are built with GNU Flex & GNU Bison.

  - We're currently working on a bytecode compiler for the Rubinius
    VM. See the rbx_bytecode branch for our current progress on that.
