----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fancy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language heavily
inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby and Erlang. It has support for dynamic
code evaluation (as in Ruby & Smalltalk), concurrency via the
actor-model and many more features yet to be implemented.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Itâ€™s currently still in development, the implementation consisting of
an interpreter written in C++.
