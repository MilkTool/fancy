The Fancy Programming Language

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fancy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language heavily
inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby and Erlang. It will support dynamic code
evaluation (as in Ruby & Smalltalk), concurrency via the actor-model
and many more features yet to be implemented.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Itâ€™s still in development, the implementation consisting of an
interpreter written in C++.

For some example code (that can be successfully executed), have a look
at the examples/ directory.

Note however, that the parser is far from done and I'm actually
considering rewriting it in peg/leg as that might turn out to be a
better option. If you want to see what the syntax is supposed to look
like (e.g. without all those silly semicolons you'll find in the
example files), have a look at the spec/ directory. There you'll find
some sample code, showing how I'd like the language to look & feel
some time in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling / Installing from source:
------------------------------------

Fancy is currently built using flex & bison for parsing and uses the
BoehmGC for garbage collection. You'll need the following
libraries/programms in order to build the sources:
  - GNU Make
  - Bison
  - Flex
  - libgc ( BoehmGC - you can also get it here:
            http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ )

For example, to build on Ubuntu Linux, run:
  $ cd <fancy_source_path>
  $ sudo apt-get install make bison flex libgc-dev
  $ make && make test

Some technical information:
----------------------------


What's already working?
------------------------

  - (Simple) Class definitions
  - (Simple) Instance method definitions
  - String, Integer, Float, Array & Block literals
  - Method & Operator calls
  - Instance & class variable access
  - Simple loops
  - Simple support for closures (it works but there's definately room
    for performance improvements)


What's still missing?
----------------------

  - Pattern matching
  - Concurrency stuff (Actor-model based concurrency features as in
    Erlang)
  - Some more advanced stuff, e.g. runtime inspection of method calls
    via MethodContext etc. (advanced stuff - saved for later)


How is it implemented?
-----------------------

  - Currently, theres a quite simple interpreter written in
    non-idiomatic C++. 
    Sorry, I'm not a big C++ programmer. It should be fairly easy to
    read though.

  - It uses the BoehmGC for garbage collection.

  - Currently the lexer & parser are built with flex & bison.

  - I'm planning to add a compiler later on, maybe even written in the
    language itself. Possible targets include beam (Erlang VM), LLVM,
    JVM, ... ?
    I'd prefer not writing my own vm from scratch. Erlang would seem a
    nice fit considering its concurrency model & vm support. Multiple
    targets would obviously rock even more ;)
