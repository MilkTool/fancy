----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fancy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language heavily
inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby and Erlang. It will support dynamic code
evaluation (as in Ruby & Smalltalk), concurrency via the actor-model
and many more features yet to be implemented.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Itâ€™s currently still in development, the implementation consisting of
an interpreter written in C++.

For some example code (that can be successfully executed), have a look
at the examples/ directory.
