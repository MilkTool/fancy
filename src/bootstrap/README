Fancy src/bootstrap directory
------------------------------

This directory consists of the following:

  - core_classes.cc:
    - Defines all built-in classes and singleton objects (true & nil)
      in the root scope (called 'global_scope')
    - Calls the remaining initialize functions for all built-in
      classes (found in the remaining source files)

  - remaining source files:
    - Each source file deals with one built-in class (except for
      exceptions.cc, which handles all built-in Exception classes)
    - Initialize all class & instance methods for the built-in classes
