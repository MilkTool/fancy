Fancy src/ directory
---------------------

This directory consists of the following:

  - bootstrap/ directory:
    Containing all the built-in classes & methods.
    The code in there gets run during interpreter initialization.

  - parser/ directory:
    Contains all parser-related code, including:
      - GNU Bison & Flex input files (fancy.y & fancy.lex)
      - parser node classes (that form the AST) in parser/nodes/

  - remaining source files, including:
    - Wrapper classes for Fancy's built-in classes.
    - Identifier class (represents a name in Fancy code)
    - main.cc containing Fancy's entry point
    - utils.cc containing utility functions (for warning & error output)
    - errors.cc containing Fancy's built-in Exception classes
    - Scope class (used by the AST to get the values for identifiers)
