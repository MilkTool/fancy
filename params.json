{"name":"Fancy","body":"### Welcome to Fancy.\r\nFancy is a new dynamic, pure object-oriented programming language for the [Rubinius VM](http://rubini.us).\r\nIt is heavily inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby, Io and Erlang.\r\nFancy has built-in support for concurrency via the actor model, similar to Io or Erlang and allows you to use almost any Ruby library out there, including most C extensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThis will get you going with the latest and greatest version of Fancy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/bakkdoor/fancy.git\r\n$ cd fancy\r\n$ rake\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart it up!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/fancy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr run the test suite:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/fancy bin/fspec\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor your convenience make sure to add Fancy's `bin` directory to your `$PATH` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/fancy/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer using an official release, you can install Fancy as a Ruby gem, just make sure you're running it via Rubinius:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rbx -S gem install fancy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr use rvm / rbenv:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rvm install rbx\r\n$ rvm use rbx\r\n$ gem install fancy\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Libraries / Examples\r\nThere are a bunch of (somewhat unrealistic) code examples in the [examples](https://github.com/bakkdoor/fancy/tree/master/examples) directory. \r\nAlso, here's a list of libraries / repositories (Fancy packages) you can install and play with:\r\n\r\n* [Redis client](https://github.com/bakkdoor/redis.fy)\r\n* [Sinatra web development for Fancy](https://github.com/rkh/sinatra.fy)\r\n* [MessagePack serialization / RPC](https://github.com/bakkdoor/msgpack.fy)\r\n* [IRC client / IRC bots](https://github.com/bakkdoor/fancy_irc)\r\n* [Sample link shortener service with sinatra.fy and redis.fy](https://github.com/bakkdoor/shortefy)\r\n* [Fancy DSL for Twitter's Storm (WIP)](https://github.com/bakkdoor/stormify)\r\n\r\nAnd some utility repositories:\r\n\r\n* [Snippets for Fancy's Emacs mode](https://github.com/bakkdoor/fancy-snippets)\r\n* [VIM mode for Fancy](https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/fancy-vim)\r\n","tagline":"A dynamic, pure object-oriented programming language inspired by Smalltalk, Ruby, Io and Erlang that runs on the Rubinius VM.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
