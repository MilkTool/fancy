This directory contains all the AST Node classes used by the
compiler. Most of them inherit from an equivalent Ruby Node class
defined in rbx's lib/compiler/ directory.

Each node class has a bytecode: method in which the actual bytecode
generation is done by calling generator methods on the generator
object, that is passed in as an argument.

If there's no bytecode: method defined in a node class, this just
means, we're simply using the bytecode: method of the superclass (the
one defined by rbx's compiler library).
