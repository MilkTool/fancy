    A few files have other copyright holders. A few of the files needed
    to use the GNU-style build procedure come with a modified GPL license
    that appears not to significantly restrict use of the collector, though
    use of those files for a purpose other than building the collector may
    require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.
