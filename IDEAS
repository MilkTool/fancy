Here's a list of ideas for features in Fancy:

- Metadata attachable to each object (similar to how it's done in Clojure)
  -> Fancy has docstrings, which also can be attached to each single
     object in the language.
     Metadata would allow the programmer to attach _any_ data to each
     object in the language.

- Some form of multiple dispatch?
  -> Need to come up with a good syntactical & semantical way of
     expressing that.
